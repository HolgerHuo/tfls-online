      Tianjin Foreign Languages School (TFLS) was one of xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /?China’s first seven foreign languages schools, since the foundation of People’s Republic of China. It was under the guidance and approval of Zhou Enlai, one of founding fathers and the first premier of China, that the school was founded in 1964. Tianjin Foreign Language School has been enjoying widespread fame and popularity in China. The People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Education has even directly delivered several papers to keep and further enhance its own features of foreign languages. The former Deputy Secretary General of UN and personal interpreter of Zhou Enlai, Ji Chaozhu is our honorary principal. TFLS is under the direct supervision of Tianjin Municipal Education Commission. Due to this close tie, Tianjin Foreign Language School was given its pet name “xiaowai.” xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /?

     Our guiding objective: We aim to run a national first-class foreign language school with modernization and internationalization as our distinctive features.

Guiding Characteristics: Specialized in foreign languages，Open-minded in modern education

Educating objective: Prepare students to be worldwide talents.

     Therefore, TFLS is the best choice for those international students, who intend to learn Chinese and Chinese culture, develop international awareness, and broaden their horizons. 

     TFLS is a state-run boarding school, which includes junior high and senior high school. We also enroll both Chinese and international students. The international students will take classes together with their Chinese counterparts, after enrolling. For those whose language competence of Chinese cannot meet their needs, the school will appoint specialized tutors to improve their Chinese competence gradually. 

     By having access to international educational resources and sharing China’s educational resources, TFLS embodies the combination of internationalization and localization and spares no effort to a create pleasant and favorable learning environment. This environment helps to facilitate the development of students’ personalities, and specialties. We also cultivate students’ international awareness and competitiveness, and at the same time we aim at fulfilling their greatest potential. We follow the line of quality-oriented education to value individual needs and talents, and show their distinctive ability. We hold both Chinese and English courses; this enables students not only to learn Chinese, but also, to master another foreign language, so as to communicate with it. International students can improve themselves in many fields, such as, language competence, knowledge, culture, willpower, and personality. These improvements can lead to an enjoyable and colorful growth. Students’ experiences here can help form the sound basis to integrate into the professional world and become a messenger, who promotes international cultural communication. 

     Tianjin Foreign Language School offers classes in Liberal Arts and classes in Science, with foreign language as its specialty. Students can choose between English, Japanese, German, French and Spanish as their first foreign language. TFLS uses foreign textbooks and limits the number of students in each class. This ensures a consistently high quality of education in each and every class. All classes are equipped with native foreign language speakers, for oral courses and second foreign languages, such as English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish and Korean. Every student will become fluent in their first foreign language and have a good command of a second foreign language. Many students in junior high pass CET 4 or even CET 6 for English learners or level 2 of JLPT for Japanese learners, two tests for college students’ level. Every year our students win many prizes in national English and Japanese competitions. Furthermore, we also have science students achieve excellent results in national competitions of science, winning many first and second place prizes. 

     TFLS is one of the few foreign language schools which have the qualifications to recommend students for admission to the University. Twenty per cent of our students will be recommended to enter many of the forty leading universities; this includes the celebrated Beijing University and Tsinghua University. In the past few years, the students directly recommended to University has accounted for half of those from the whole city of Tianjin Municipality. Almost a hundred students have gained permission from highly prestigious Universities in the world, such as Harvard University, Yale University, University of Toronto, dozens receiving full scholarships. Every year the number of the students recommended by our school and admitted to Chinese and foreign famous universities is over 150. Apart from those recommended to study abroad, ninety percent of students have been admitted to leading universities in China after Gaokao. 

     With continuous improvement of teaching quality, TFLS has been strengthening cooperation with other schools from abroad, taking advantage of its edge in foreign languages. In the past few years, our international communication and cooperation has been broadened. We have established relationships with many sister schools overseas. Every year delegations of staff and students are sent to one of our sister schools. These cultural exchanges have greatly aided our approach to education and have helped us reach a higher international standard. We have also received many delegations from USA, Japan, Germany, France, and Denmark. The members took courses rich in Chinese culture, such as Chinese calligraphy, tai chi, Beijing Opera, paper-cutting, and visited many of the tourist attractions in Beijing and Tianjin. Chinese students and their international counterparts have put on many excellent shows, which have helped to develop a deep intimacy between them. Those activities helped our students in three main ways: 1.) They were able to share some interesting aspects of Chinese culture, 2.) improved students’ social abilities and their ability to communicate with their foreign language, 3.) and they also enhanced their understanding of global partnership and friendship.

     Students here at Tianjin Foreign Language School can take part in many activities and clubs. The clubs include Model United Nations, Choir Club, Wind Music Club, National Arts Club, and many others. The school also arranges many activity involving foreign languages, such as Foreign Language Corner, Foreign Language Day, Foreign Language Culture Festival, and foreign language competitions. Model United Nations has won many prizes and was awarded a prize for “Excellent Clubs of Tianjin Municipality.” Our Arts Club has been taken to many International Children Art Festivals and has won many prizes.
