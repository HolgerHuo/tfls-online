老师们，同学们：大家好！xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /?

在人生的岁月中，每个人面对的都是现在和将来，过去总是一去不复返，只能留下或深刻或模糊的记忆，因此有人说，过去就过去了，要过好现在，放眼未来；也有人说，过去无法追回，回顾过去只能追悔莫及。我们或许也有同样感受，翻阅过去的日历，既有成功的愉悦，也有失败的苦涩，还有忧郁的困惑，如果反省过去，那真是倒了五味瓶，甜酸苦辣什么滋味都有。

其实，回头想一想，过去并没有过去，依然封存着丰富的生活阅历，仔细阅读依然是人生的一本教科书。只要能认真反省，就能从中品味出人生的味道。荀子说：“君子博学而日常省乎已，则知明而行无过矣。”布朗宁也说：“能够反躬自省的人，就一定不是庸俗的人。”

宋代理学家朱熹还这样教诲：“日省其身，有则改之，无则加勉。”所以，反省过去如同雕琢一块天然矿石，唯有认真地用刀去雕琢，把身上的污垢剔掉，虽然疼痛，却能雕琢出人生的价值。因此，反省过去就是提高自我，就能总结出伤痛的教训，然后不断改正，去追求将来的成功。如果不去反省也不愿意反省，只能让自己痛上加痛，在失败的泥沼里愈陷愈深。因此，反省过去是人生成功的一块基石。

在古今中外的成功人士中，善于反省是他们高尚人格的体现。春秋战国时的廉颇处处与蔺相如为难，但蔺相如却有博大宽容的胸怀。当廉颇听到蔺相如对敌狠对友宽的肺腑之言之后，反省自己，最终悔悟，向蔺相如负荆请罪，二人终成好友，“将相和”的故事也一直传诵至今。还有美国总统林肯，他曾两次经商失败，七次竞选参议员落选，甚至精神崩溃卧床不起。但他没有危惧失败，而是认真反省过去的失败，总结经验，继续奋斗。有人统计，他一生失败过三十五次，只成功过三次，而第三次终于成功当选为美国总统。

所以，反省过去，可以使品性得到升华，思维更加敏捷，思路更加宽广；可以在自我的大海里找到正确的航向，朝着将来的彼岸进发；而且，反省过去还可以放弃错误锁链的束缚，使人自然轻松的直面人生，从而走向成功。

同学们，期中考试已经临近。这既是知识的检测，也是意志的磨炼。我们不仅要有平和认真的心态和辛勤的耕耘，更要有着反思过去的精神。塞翁失马焉知非福，如果一味沉迷在过去的挫败感中，只会一退再退，从此一蹶不振，淹没在前进的洪流之中；而理智地面对得失、认真地分析原因，却能撬开通向成功的门。从过去的失败中获得教训，从过去的成功中总结经验，只有这样，才能不断发现自己成长的空间，不断从过去汲取养分，不断向顶峰攀登。

希望同学们能够以这次考试为契机，学会反躬自省，做一个睿智的人；并祝愿大家在期中考试中取得好成绩！

Everyone faces their present and future in their lives, while the past will never be back, and all that is left is memory, impression or vagueness. Perhaps we all share the feeling that when we recall the past, we may find that our memory is actually a concoction of happiness, bitterness, and confusion. 

However, the past has not really passed. It stores abundant experiences and is always a textbook worth reading. Self-examination is like carving jade. Only by tremendous amount of chiseling and polishing, and eliminating the flaws, can a jewel reveal its value, although it suffers piercing pain. The same can be said of life. That is to say, self-examination is a process of improving ourselves, during which we gain the enlightenment from disappointment and failures and rectify mistakes, in order to pursue a better success in future. Conversely, if we refuse to question ourselves, we will only add to the pain and sink deeper and deeper in the swamp of failure. 

American president Lincoln used to fail twice in business and seven times in the elections of Senator. However, he has never been defeated. Instead, he faced the difficulties with profound courage and persistence, avoiding his disadvantages and utilizing his dominance to keep on striving. According to statistics, Abraham Lincoln has failed 35 times in total in his whole life, compared to merely three times of success. The third time was when he was selected to be the president of the xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /?United States of America. Thus, we may conclude that, self-examination is the cornerstone of success.

Recalling on the past can cultivate our taste, broaden our horizon, and boost our thoughts. What’s more, it can help us to find out the interior sailing directions towards our destinations, go beyond the bond of blunders, and confront life with a more relaxed attitude. 

With the approaching of mid-term examination, we will be tested on both our knowledge and determination. It requires not only our positive attitude and eternal efforts, but also our reflection on the past. Indulging in the past failure, one will continuously fall behind and get lost in competition. The key to success lies in a rational approach to the result and a deep analysis. We should grasp the opportunity of this examination to further reflect on ourselves and, thus, become wiser. In the end, we sincerely wish everyone good luck in mid-term examination!
