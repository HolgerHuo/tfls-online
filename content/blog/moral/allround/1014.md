农历八月十五,是我国传统的中秋节。金桂飘香,花好月圆,在这美好的节日里，人们赏月、吃月饼、走亲访友……享受着团圆带来的喜悦。




当我们在中秋月圆之夜仰望苍穹之时,脑海中一定会浮现起那优美的词句--但愿人长久,千里共婵娟。宋代大词人苏轼借助明月表达了对亲人朋友的思念之情以及美好祝愿,使我们更加珍惜这浓郁的团圆气氛。




但同学们在喜悦之中可曾想过？在世界各地,又有多少人守着这皎洁的圆月却要忍受战争、暴乱带来的痛苦灾难，无法与亲人团圆。战火硝烟之处，有多少妇女儿童成为孤儿寡母，多少无辜的人无家可归。在他们心中，拥有一个和平的生活，哪怕是一天，都是一个遥不可及的梦想。他们对美好的生活该是何等的企盼！




在中秋节两天过后的9月21日就是世界和平日。当我们沉浸在和平带来的幸福美满的生活之中时，请不要忘记了那些尚在危难之中的人们。让我们默默地祈祷，愿他们能早日拥有安定的生活，愿和平鸽永远翱翔在世界的碧空蓝天！

**Thoughts of peace on
mid-Autumn Festival**




**August 15th in lunar calendar
is our traditional mid-Autumn Festival which is also the second popular
traditional festival in our country. August 15th is in the middle of autumn and
that's where the name came from.**




**As a
tradition, people eat moon cakes, visit their relatives and friends and share
the beauty of the moon during this wonderful time. What's more, they enjoy the
happiness of gathering with the whole family.**




**It must have
reminded us of the graceful verse"Though miles apart, could men but live
forever dreaming they shared this moonlight endlessly!" when we look up
into the moon on mid-Autumn Festival eve. The great poet Su Shi expressed his
remembrance and blessing of his friends and relatives with the help of the
moon, making us cherish even more of this strong gathering atmosphere.**




**But my dear
fellows, have you ever thought of how many people may live a life of horror,
pain, and sadness brought by war and chaos but acompanied by the beautiful and
clear moon at the same time? To us, peace is what we call reality. But to those
who live in a terrifying war or conflict, peace is what they have been longing
for their whole life.**




**Two days after
the mid-Autumn festival (in Gregorian calendar) is the International Peace Day which
is on September 21th. The same time as we have the right to enjoy the gathering
moment of mid-Autumn Festival and the peaceful life from our country, it is
even more important for us to call on peace for every corner in the world. Let’s
give our best try for opposing any sort of activity that is defined as peace
damaging/ruining and wish the fairy blue bird shall be ever flying in the sky
of peace.**




**Thank you for
your listening.**
