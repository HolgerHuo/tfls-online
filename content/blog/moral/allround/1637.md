又一年九月，又一年中秋。




农历的八月十五，我国的传统节日——中秋节。它处在一年秋季的中期，所以称为“中秋”，它仅仅次于春节，是我国的第二大传统节日。




中秋之夜，月色皎洁，古人把圆月视为团圆的象征，因此，又称八月十五为“团圆节”。中秋节与元宵节和端午节并称为我国三大传统佳节。究中秋节之来源，与“嫦娥奔月”、“吴刚伐桂”、“玉兔捣药”等神话传说有着密切的关系。嫦娥偷吃了丈夫后羿从西王母那儿讨来的不死之药后，飞到了月宫。但琼楼玉宇，高处不胜寒，嫦娥向丈夫倾诉懊悔后，又说：“明天乃月圆之候，你用面粉作丸，团团如圆月形状，放在屋子的西北方向，然后再连续呼唤我的名字。三更时分，我就可以回家来了。”翌日，照妻子的吩咐去做，届时嫦娥果由月中飞来，夫妻重圆。故中秋节的民间习俗多与月亮有关。赏月、拜月、吃团圆月饼等，均源于此。古代帝王有春天祭日，秋天祭月的社制，民家也有中秋祭月之风，到了后来赏月重于祭月，严肃的祭祀变成了轻松的欢娱。中秋赏月的风俗在唐代极盛，许多诗人的名篇中都有咏月的诗句，宋代、明代、清代宫廷和民间的拜月赏月活动更具规模。我国各地至今遗存着许多“拜月坛”、“拜月亭”、“望月楼”的古迹。北京的“月坛”就是明嘉靖年间为皇家祭月修造的。每当中秋月亮升起，于露天设案，将月饼、石榴、枣子等瓜果供于桌案上，拜月后，全家人围桌而坐，边吃边谈，共赏明月。现在，祭月拜月活动已被规模盛大、多彩多姿的群众赏月游乐活动所替代。




这是一个温馨而愉快的节日，这期间人们赏月、吃月饼、走亲访友……所有的这些让中秋暖意融融，这是名为亲情的力量。




中国人特别讲究亲情，特别珍视团圆，中秋节尤为甚。 中秋，是一个飘溢亲情的节日；中秋，是一个弥漫团圆的时节。这个时节，感受亲情、释放亲情、增进亲情；这个时节，盼望团圆、追求团圆、享受团圆……这些，构成了人们的生活，构成了这个节日特别的温暖气氛。




在这金秋送爽的九月,在这一年一度的中秋佳节,当欣赏皓月当空的美景时,当我们仰望苍穹时,我们是否会想起远方的亲人和朋友，多年未见，你还好么？我们是否会想起身边的亲人，每天傍晚，父母做好饭菜在家等候我们，当我们离家，他们目送我们远去，默默担忧。这份深厚的爱，又如何回报？




这个中秋，请给在远方的亲人寄去一声问候:中秋快乐，诉说思念，相互鼓舞，传递亲情的力量。




这个中秋，请给家中的父母递上一杯清茶，送上一口月饼，表达对他们的感恩，告诉他们，孩子已经长大，已经渐渐成熟，让他们不要再担心，让亲情的温暖洋溢。




俗话说，儿行千里母担忧，从今以后，我们要学会更加努力，更加坚强，我们多一分成熟，父母就会少一分担忧，无论我们走到哪里，请挂念着时刻爱着我们的亲人和朋友，让每一天，都是暖意融融的中秋节

September again, the Mid-Autumn Festival again.




The 15thof
the eighth lunar month is our traditional festival--the Mid-Autumn Festival. It
is the second most important traditional festival to us Chinese.




During the night
of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the full silver moon rises and looks
bright and clear. And it is thought to be the symbol of family reunion. The
history of the Moon Festival is relevant to the stories of ‘Chang’ e flying to
the moon’, ‘Wu Gang chopping the tree’ and ‘Jade hare making heavenly medicine’.
After Chang’ e ate the elixir by accident, she flew to the moon. However, it is
freezing on the moon, so Chang complained to her husband and said, ‘Tomorrow
night there will be a full moon, please make a round mass of food from flour and
put it in the northeast of the house. Then you need to call my name
continuously. I’ll be back at midnight. The following day, Hou Yi did so as
what his wife’s said. At that moment, Chang’ e flew off the moon and the couple
met each other just as expected. Therefore, the folk customs of the Mid-Autumn
Festival are related to the moon. Emperors in ancient China observed a custom
of praying to the sun in Spring and to the moon in Autumn. We Chinese civilians
also have the custom of praying to the moon. But through many years’ of
evolution, people enjoy the entertainment activities instead of praying to the
glorious full moon. Nowadays, during this warm and pleasant festival, people
usually enjoying gazing at and appreciating the full moon, relishing mooncakes
of many varieties with a good cup of tea and visiting their relatives and
friends. All these activities make the Mid-Autumn Festival warm., which is the
power of familial affection. In this cool autumn, during this annual Mid-Autumn
Festival, when we appreciate a bright moon hanging in the sky, when we look up
at the firmament, shall we think of our relatives or friends far away? At
nightfall, every day our parents prepare the dinner and wait for us to get home
to have dinner together. When we leave home, they will follow us with their
eyes and worry about us silently. Facing this deep love, how shall we feel
gratitude and requite?




During this
wonderful festival, please send greetings to the relatives in the distance.




During the
festival, please serve our parents by offering a cup of tea respectfully.




There’s a famous
saying ‘Mothers always worry about their sons who are far away from home.’ From
now on, we should work hard. The more we are matured, the less worried our
parents will feel. Wherever we go, please think of our relatives and friends
who love us forever and make everyday a warm Mid- Autumn Festival.
