老师们，同学们，大家好！




五天后是中秋节。因为农历八月15日这一天是在三秋之中，所以称“中秋”。中秋节是我国传统佳节，是仅次于春节的第二大传统节日，又被认为是我们中国人的团圆节，每到这一天，许多远离家乡的游子，纷纷赶回家中，与父母亲友团聚一堂，把酒言欢。




每逢佳节倍思亲，是的，中秋节这一份思念当然会更亲切，尤其是一轮明月高挂的时刻，和家人共进一顿晚餐，为员远在他乡的亲人送上真诚的祝福，是中秋节最重要的章节，把一大块月饼切好，为远在他乡的亲人留下一份思念，举杯共进，分享点点滴滴地家常事，说说生活中的烦恼，是情感最真诚的流露。




中秋节，是一个飘溢亲情的节日，是一个弥漫团圆的时节。这个时节，让我们尽情感受亲情，释放亲情，增进亲情；这个时节，盼望团圆，追求团圆、享受团圆。




中秋最美是亲情。一家人团聚在一起，讲不完的话，叙不完的情，诉说着人们同一个心声：亲情是黑暗中的灯塔，是荒漠中的甘泉，是雨后的彩虹……




中秋最美是思念。月亮最美，美不过思念；月亮最高，高不过想念。中秋圆月会把我们的目光和思念传递给我们想念的人和我们牵挂的人，祝他们没有忧愁，永远幸福，没有烦恼，永远快乐！




中秋最美是感恩！无须多言，给父母一个微笑，给亲友一个问候，递上一杯清茶，送上一口月饼，这是我们给予父母最好的回报。感谢父母给予的生命，感谢父母给予的培养……




老师们，同学们，这个中秋，我们要用一颗感恩的心来度过！心怀感恩！感恩一切造就我们的人，感恩一切帮助我们成长的人！心怀感恩！我们才懂得尊敬师长，才懂得关心帮助他人，才懂得勤奋学习、珍爱自己，才会拥有快乐，拥有幸福！




老师们，同学们，中秋最美，美不过一颗感恩的心！中秋最美，美不过真心祝福！在此我代表全体同学，为敬爱的老师们送上我们真诚的祝福，祝您们中秋快乐，一切圆满！同时，也祝同学们，中秋快乐！！！




Dear teachers and school mates:




       Good morning!




Five days later we are going to celebrate the Mid Autumn Festival.Mid Autumn Festival is a traditional festival in China. It's the second largest traditional festival after the Spring Festival, it's considered as our Chinese reunion festival. On that day, many people who live outside far away home come back to their hometown ,get together with their family and chat with each other about something happened last year.




During the festival, we miss our family and friends much more than before, especially when the bright moon is up to the dark sky. 




And the most important part of the festival is sending sincere blessing to relatives and having a big dinner with all of your family.Sharing something special and talking about the worries of life, are the most sincere outpouring of emotion.




The Mid Autumn Festival, is a festival fulled of affection and a festival filled reunion.During this festival, let's enjoy the feeling of family, release the affection of family and enhance the relationship of family. During this festival, let's look forward to reunion and enjoy the reunion.




The most beautiful part of Mid Autumn is the affection of family. The affection is like the Lighthouse in the darkness ,it's like the oasis in the desert, and it's the rainbow after the rain.




The most beautiful part of Mid Autumn is missing .The moon will send our blessings to people that we miss and worry,wish them have no sorrow, no worries and happy forever !




The most beautiful part of Mid Autumn is thanksgiving.There's no need to say,just giving parents a smile, greeting to the relatives and friends, handing each people a cup of tea and sending them a piece of moon cake.This is the best reward to our parents.We should thank to the life given by parents. 




Dear teachers and schoolmates The Mid Autumn Festival is beautiful, but the sincere blessing is much more beautiful than it. On behalf of all my classmates, I wish all of you a happy Mid Autumn Festival.
