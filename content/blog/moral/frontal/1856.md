尊敬的老师、亲爱的同学们：




大家上午好！




时隔一个多星期，我们迎来了运动会后的第一个升旗仪式。大家一定都还记得一周前运动员们在操场上挥洒汗水，奋力搏击的一幕幕场景吧？那里曾经有过胜利者的欢歌笑语，也曾有过失败者的暗自垂泪。但无论是成功者还是失败者，他们都是我们的英雄，因为他们都曾努力过，不仅挑战了自我还为我们的学校增添了精彩。




今天，同样需要我们致敬的是105年前参加辛亥革命的英雄们。1911年10月10日，辛亥革命爆发，无数革命先烈们不畏强权，殊死奋战，终于给了封建专制制度以致命的一击——推翻了清王朝二百六十多年的专制统治，并建立了资产阶级共和国。




我们说辛亥革命是伟大的，它以反对君主专制制度并建立资产阶级共和国为目标，在政治上、思想上给中国人民带来了不可低估的解放作用。随着封建帝制的消除，民族平等、民权自由、民生幸福的呼声在中华大地上回荡。空前民主的气象，竞办实业的浪潮，形成了生机勃勃的局面。同时，辛亥革命也为人们破除了封建迷信，解放了思想，提高了人们的民族民主意识，为建立民主共和国做好了思想准备。中华儿女从此有了崭新的面貌以走向新的生活、新的起点。




今日，我们纪念辛亥革命，因为辛亥首义功绩彪炳千秋。今日，我们纪念辛亥革命，因为辛亥志士永垂不朽。今日，我们纪念辛亥革命，还因为辛亥革命为我们留下了一笔弥足珍贵的精神财富——辛亥武昌首义精神。那么作为新世纪学生的我们应该如何继承和发扬这种首义精神呢？




首义精神的核心是救国救民、振兴中华的强烈爱国主义精神。无数革命志士之所以不畏艰险，敢于牺牲正是因为他们时刻心系国家民族。我们要继承和发扬首义精神，首先需要高举爱国主义这面大旗，把中华儿女的智慧和力量凝聚起来，努力实现中华民族的伟大复兴！




“世人未为我敢为，天下未发我首发。”传承辛亥武昌首义精神，还要传承这种勇立潮头，敢为人先的创新精神。今日，无论是在科技还是经济领域，无论是在思想还是文化领域，这种敢闯、敢干、敢试、敢为天下先的大无畏精神所具有爆发力、原创力定能让我们创造出一番新天地！




“革命尚未成功，同志仍需努力！”传承辛亥武昌首义精神，更是要传承这种一呼百应，精诚团结的协作精神。今日，我们青年学生要具有这种团结协作的精神与态度，与同学精诚团结，互相协作，努力进取！




同学们，105年前，孙中山先生率先喊出了“振兴中华”的口号。105年后，振兴中华，维护祖国统一，让国家富强，民族复兴，将靠我们这些新中国的建设者和接班人来担当。同学们，让我们一起向先辈们立誓，继承他们为振兴中华矢志不渝的崇高精神，志存高远，脚踏实地，让首义精神代代相传！




谢谢大家！

高二五班宣




 




The Revolution of 1911




Dear teachers and
school mates:




Good morning! It has been a week since the Autumn
Sports Meet was hold. I believe everyone remembers the efforts that our
athletes made on this sports ground. No matter they won or not, they were our heroes.
Because they once tried their best to bring the glory to their classes and at
the same time made this Autumn Sports Meet incredibly splendid.




Today, there are also a group of people that we should
pay tribute to: the heroes in the Revolution of 1911. Under the oppression of
these bureaucratic might, those heroes stood out to fight. They sacrificed
their own lives to give the feudal autocracy a lethal strike and finally
devastated the feudal society ruled by the Qing Dynasty for more than tow
hundred and sixty years. The bourgeois-democratic republic nation---The Republic
of China, was established.




We consider the Revolution of 1911 as remarkable
because its ultimate goal is to fight against the feudal autocracy and
establish a new democratic and republic nation. This revolution liberated
people’s thought to a great degree in both political and spiritual aspect , and
which brought the flush of dawn to Chinese society. Since then, nationalism,
democracy, and people’s livelihood have been deeply rooted in people’s mind.
The emergence of several new Chinese factories and companies made the moribund
society vibrant again. The slogan “Save the nation by getting engaged in
industry” urged more and more businessmen to change their trading companies
into technological factories. Many feudal customs were abolished. Chinese
people began to set out for a brand new life.




Today,we commemorate the revolution of 1911 not only
because of the prominent achievement of the revolution and the immortality of
these warriers who died in this battle, but also because of the spiritual
fortune: the spirit of the Revolution of 1911.




There’s an old saying in China which says: Although
Chu kingdom owns few lands, it can still destroy Qin Dynasty. The first merit
you have to inherit from the spirit of the Revolution of 1911 is patriotism. In
contemporary society, we raise the flag of patriotism to gather people’s
intelligence and power in order to achieve the great renaissance of the Chinese
nation. The next character that we have to learn is the spirit of innovation.
Nowadays, no matter in technological or economical area, we should spread
innovation spirit because this spirit owns creativity and can strive us to
explore a new era. Last but not least, we have to inherit the spirit of unity.
Today, as teenage students, we should adopt this attitude. Work as a group,
cooperate with others. Because cooperation is the most efficient way to
success. Only by becoming united  and
stepping forward together can we become stronger and better.




We, junior and senior school students, should not be
satisfied with the temporary  comfort. We
have to move on. It is not enough only to consider about these daily affairs.
We have to look ahead upon our future life and focuse on the causes. This life
is ours, so we should make good plans for it. And also, when we are thinking
further, we should think big. Think about the country’s future and what you can
do to improve it. Your pursuit is the most valuable only when it shares the
same direction with the country’s development. Every teenager should have a
greater pursuit, should devote himself to causes which benefit people.
Dedicating yourselves to philanthropy can let you do beneficial things to
society and meanwhile realize your value of life.




Ladies and Gentlemen, a hundred and five years ago,
Mr.Sun Yat-sen raised the war cry “Revitalize the Chinese nation”. And today,
we are the generation who’s mission is to realize this ambition . Dear teachers
and school mates, let’s swear to our ancestors: we will inherit the spirit of
the Revolution of 1911 and let it be 
passed on through generations.




Thank you.
