Everyone
contributed his own bit. There were a large number of visitors to our haunted
house, which made it really difficult to entertain them. However, some of us
stayed outside to put the visitors in order, some took them around the house,
and some were inside the house to scare them. Nobody was free. Everybody was
very tired, but there weren’t any complaints. We were all glad to do that
because we knew that we were a family. Our unity really moved me. And this is
the most important thing I’ve learned since I came to our AP Center.




  I have acquired a lot in the AP Center. I am
really glad to be here with so many great friends to enjoy my school life. And
I’m looking forward to having a more fabulous school life here!
